# Webcam Integration Summary

## What Was Added

I've successfully enhanced your Streamlit app with **live webcam detection** support! üé•

## Created Files

### 1. **app.py** (Enhanced - WebRTC Version)

- Added `streamlit-webrtc` integration
- Supports browser-based webcam streaming
- Best for production/deployed applications
- Requires HTTPS or localhost

### 2. **app_opencv_webcam.py** (NEW - Recommended)

- Uses OpenCV for direct webcam access
- Simpler and works better locally
- Real-time detection overlay
- Easy start/stop controls
- **Currently running on http://localhost:8503**

### 3. **requirements.txt**

- Lists all dependencies including webcam packages

### 4. **README_WEBCAM.md**

- Complete usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Configuration tips

## Key Features

### Three Input Methods (Tabs)

#### üì∑ Tab 1: Upload Images

- Upload single or multiple images
- Same functionality as before

#### üé• Tab 2: Live Webcam

- **Start Webcam** button to activate camera
- Real-time detection overlay on video
- Live readings displayed in sidebar
- **Capture Frame** button to save current readings
- **Stop Webcam** to close camera

#### üìÅ Tab 3: Batch Processing

- Process entire directories
- Progress bar for batch jobs

### Telemetry Dashboard

- View all readings (uploaded, webcam, batch)
- Download as CSV
- Confidence distribution charts
- Clear data button

## How to Use Webcam

### Quick Start

1. **Open the app** (already running):

   ```
   http://localhost:8503
   ```

2. **Navigate to "Live Webcam" tab**

3. **Click "Start Webcam"**

   - Your camera will activate
   - You'll see live detection overlay

4. **Position the incubator display** in front of camera

5. **Watch real-time readings** in the right panel

6. **Click "Capture Frame"** to save a reading

   - Adds to telemetry log
   - Can download as CSV later

7. **Click "Stop Webcam"** when done

## Technical Details

### How It Works

```python
# OpenCV captures frames
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 = default camera

# Each frame is processed
while webcam_active:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Run YOLO detection
    annotated = reader.annotate_image(frame, conf=conf_threshold)

    # Display annotated frame
    st.image(annotated)

    # Extract readings
    readings = reader.read(frame)
```

### Performance

- Processes frames in real-time
- Adjustable confidence threshold
- Annotated overlay shows detections
- OCR runs on detected regions only

## Comparison of Versions

### app_opencv_webcam.py (Recommended for Local)

‚úÖ Simpler to use locally
‚úÖ Direct camera access
‚úÖ No complex setup needed
‚úÖ Better performance
‚ùå Requires local camera access

### app.py (WebRTC Version)

‚úÖ Works in production (with HTTPS)
‚úÖ Browser-based streaming
‚úÖ Can work remotely
‚ùå More complex setup
‚ùå Requires STUN/TURN servers for remote access

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Installed dependencies (streamlit-webrtc, av)
- [x] Created OpenCV webcam version
- [x] Created WebRTC webcam version
- [x] Added three-tab interface
- [x] Real-time detection overlay
- [x] Frame capture functionality
- [x] Live readings display
- [x] Telemetry logging
- [x] App running on port 8503

### üéØ Ready to Use

- Open http://localhost:8503
- Click "Live Webcam" tab
- Start detecting from your camera!

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Multiple Camera Support**

   - Add camera selection dropdown
   - Switch between cameras

2. **Recording**

   - Save video with annotations
   - Export to MP4

3. **Auto-Capture**

   - Capture frames automatically every N seconds
   - Useful for continuous monitoring

4. **Alerts**

   - Set threshold alerts for values
   - Visual/audio notifications

5. **Statistics**
   - Real-time graphs
   - Trend analysis over time

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working?

1. **Check permissions**: Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Camera
2. **Close other apps** using camera (Teams, Zoom, etc.)
3. **Try different camera**: Edit line `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`

### Performance Issues?

1. **Increase sleep time**: Change `time.sleep(0.1)` to `time.sleep(0.3)`
2. **Lower resolution**: Add `cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)`
3. **Skip frames**: Process every 2nd or 3rd frame

### Detection Not Accurate?

1. **Adjust confidence**: Use sidebar slider (try 0.15-0.35)
2. **Better lighting**: Ensure display is well-lit
3. **Clear view**: Keep display unobstructed
4. **Stable position**: Reduce camera shake

## Example Workflow

```
1. Open app (http://localhost:8503)
2. Adjust confidence slider (sidebar)
3. Go to "Live Webcam" tab
4. Click "Start Webcam"
5. Position incubator display
6. Watch live readings appear
7. Click "Capture Frame" to log reading
8. Repeat captures as needed
9. Go to "All Telemetry Data" section
10. Download CSV with all readings
```

Enjoy your new live webcam detection feature! üöÄüìπ
